Access Modifiers
In the PHP programming language, every property and method of a class can have access modifiers which control their accessibility in the entire program.

There are three access modifiers in PHP:



Public
Protected
Private


Below is a table for a better understanding of the access modifiers



Class Member Access Specifier Access from own class Accessible from derived class Accessible by Object
Private Yes No No
Protected Yes Yes No
Public Yes Yes Yes


Public
Public property or method can be accessed by any code whether that code is inside or outside of that class. If a property or method is declared public, then it can be accessed anywhere from the code.

Example:

<?php

use Employeee as GlobalEmployeee;

class Employeee
{
    public $name;
}

$emp1 = new GlobalEmployeee();
$emp1->name = 'Harry';
?>


Protected
Protected property or method can only be accessed within the class and by the classes derived from that class.

Example:

<?php
class ParentClass
{
    protected $parentMsg = "protected parent attribute<br>";
    protected function parentDisplay()
    {
        echo "protected parent method<br>";
        echo $this->parentMsg;
    }
}
class ChildClass extends ParentClass
{
    protected $childMsg = "Protected Child attribute.<br>";
    public function childDisplay()
    {
        echo "Public Child method to display protected parent members:<br>";
        $this->parentDisplay();
    }
}
$child = new ChildClass();
$child->childDisplay();
?>
Output:

Public Child method to display protected parent members:
protected parent method
protected parent attribute


Private
The Private property or method can only be accessed within the class. If it is called outside of the class, then it will throw an error.

Example:

<?php
class Employee
{
    public $salary;

    private function set_salary($n)
    { // a private function
        $this->salary = $n;
    }
}

$emp1 = new GlobalEmployeee();
// $emp1->set_salary('300'); //It will throw error as It can not Access the Private Function
?>
